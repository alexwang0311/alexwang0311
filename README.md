### Hello 👋
-  I’m a software engineer @ [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/), building the next generation of SSL/TSL provisioning, management, and deployment that make the internet more secure.
-  Prior to this, I was @ Microsoft, where I worked on IaC solutions (though only used internally, but it functions like a Terraform/CloudFormation engine) that scale, automate, and secure global-scale distributed systems for a suite of Defender products.
-  I occasionally write about random tech/math topics @ medium.com/@alexwang99311
-  My personal website: alexwang0311.github.io
